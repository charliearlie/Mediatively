[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/charliearlie/show-tracker-react.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/charliearlie/show-tracker-react)

I used a name generator for the name! ðŸ’©

A small application dedicated to tracking your progress in a TV box set or series. The application's front end is built using React and Redux. The small backend API is built using Express and the TMDB API.

Design is not a priority on this project yet. I am learning React and Redux but if you would like to contribute, that would be great.
